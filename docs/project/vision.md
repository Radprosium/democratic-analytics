# Democratic Analytics — Vision

## Mission Statement

**Democratic Analytics** is an AI-powered platform designed to help citizens better understand political issues, media coverage, and public debate. By leveraging AI agents and real-time news retrieval, the platform records, analyzes, and maps the political landscape — providing users with transparent, multi-perspective analysis that empowers informed decision-making.

## The Problem

Modern political discourse is fragmented across hundreds of media outlets, each with their own editorial angle, framing, and tone. Citizens face several challenges:

- **Information overload**: Too many sources, too little time to cross-reference them
- **Media bias**: Coverage of the same event varies wildly depending on the outlet
- **Lack of context**: News is presented as isolated events, disconnected from the broader political landscape
- **Missing the full picture**: Arguments, counter-arguments, and the positions of various actors are scattered across articles and hard to synthesize
- **No historical continuity**: Subjects evolve over weeks and months, but there's no easy way to track how a debate has shifted over time

## The Solution

Democratic Analytics addresses these challenges through:

1. **Automated news retrieval** — AI agents powered by Perplexity AI continuously scan the news landscape to identify the most important political subjects of the day
2. **Subject recording & evolution** — Political subjects are persisted and enriched over time, building a living knowledge base that grows with each news cycle
3. **Multi-angle analysis** — Each subject is analyzed from multiple perspectives: the arguments for and against, the actors involved, and the media framing used
4. **Media source mapping** — Track which outlets cover which subjects, and the tone they employ (neutral, favorable, critical, alarmist, etc.)
5. **Actor tracking** — Map political actors (politicians, parties, institutions, lobbies) to the subjects they are involved in and the positions they hold
6. **Semantic search & RAG** — ChromaDB-powered vector search enables rich contextual retrieval, letting users ask natural-language questions about any subject
7. **Subject interconnection** — Understand how subjects relate to each other, how debates influence one another, and how the political landscape is structured

## Core Principles

- **Transparency**: Every analysis should be traceable — users can see the sources, the AI's reasoning, and the data behind any conclusion
- **Neutrality**: The platform does not take sides. It presents all perspectives and helps the user form their own opinion
- **Depth over speed**: Rather than chasing breaking news, the focus is on deep understanding and contextual richness
- **Evolving knowledge**: Subjects are not static snapshots. They are living documents that grow and improve as new information emerges
- **Open methodology**: The analysis methods and AI agent prompts should be documented and auditable

## Target Users

- Citizens who want to better understand political issues before forming an opinion or voting
- Journalists looking for a structured overview of a debate's landscape
- Researchers studying media framing, political communication, or public discourse
- Educators who want to teach media literacy using real-world, structured examples
- Civic organizations monitoring political developments

## Long-Term Vision

Democratic Analytics aspires to become a reference tool for political understanding — a platform where any citizen can explore a political subject from every angle, understand who says what and why, see how media outlets frame the debate, and ultimately make more informed choices. As the knowledge base grows, the platform becomes increasingly valuable, offering historical depth and cross-subject analysis that no single news article or outlet can provide.
